# ðŸš€ DSA: Dynamic Programming

Welcome to the **Dynamic Programming (DP)** repository â€” a collection of solved problems and patterns using one of the most powerful techniques in algorithm design.

This repository is ideal for developers and students preparing for coding interviews, competitive programming, or mastering data structures and algorithms.

## ðŸ’¡ What is Dynamic Programming?

Dynamic Programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant computation (Memoization or Tabulation).

It is widely used in solving optimization problems like:

- Minimum/maximum path
- Counting combinations
- Subset problems
- Longest subsequence/substring problems
